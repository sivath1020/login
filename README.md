I created this backend project using Java, Spring Boot, and MongoDB in Visual Studio Code to learn how to build a simple RESTful API connected to a NoSQL database. I installed the Spring Boot framework to make development easier and more efficient. The project includes a controller to handle API requests, a model to define the data structure, and a repository to interact with the MongoDB database. The controller has two endpoints: one for submitting form data using a POST request (/api/submit) and another for retrieving all stored entries using a GET request (/api/all). The model contains two fields — id and password — and is mapped to a MongoDB collection called FormData. I used Lombok to reduce boilerplate code in the model class. The repository extends MongoRepository, which provides built-in methods like save() and findAll() without needing custom queries. In the application.properties file, I configured the app to run on port 1610 and connect to a local MongoDB instance using the URI mongodb://localhost:27017/sivath, with the database name set to backenddb. This project is a simple and beginner-friendly example of how to build and connect a Java backend to MongoDB using Spring Boot.
