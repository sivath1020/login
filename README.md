I developed this backend project using Java, Spring Boot, and MongoDB inside Visual Studio Code to learn how to build and connect a RESTful API with a NoSQL database. The project is structured with a controller, model, and repository. The controller handles two endpoints: one for submitting form data using a POST request (/api/submit) and another for retrieving all stored entries using a GET request (/api/all). The model defines the structure of the data, which includes an id and a password field, and itâ€™s mapped to a MongoDB collection called FormData. I used Lombok annotations to keep the model class clean and avoid writing boilerplate code. The repository extends MongoRepository, which allows easy interaction with the database without writing custom queries. In the application.properties file, I configured the app to run on port 1610 and connect to a local MongoDB instance using the URI mongodb://localhost:27017/sivath, with the database name set to backenddb. This setup makes it easy to test the API locally and serves as a simple, beginner-friendly example of how to build a backend service using Java and Spring Boot.
